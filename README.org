** DONE Get PROLOG to produce html from notes
** TODO Consider Unit Tests
** DONE Consider whether I need to do a message-passing system
*** I will probably separate GUI logic from knowledge representation and stick to explicit predicates. PROLOG is already extremely flexible so I don't think I'll be losing too much, especially given I'm probably keeping a lot of this stuff static.
** DONE Consider ref component further
** DONE Add CSS headers
** DONE Come up with a better string formatting solution
** DONE Consider Modules
** DONE Add depth-based indentation
** DONE Abstract node-specific rendering and have basic rendering for nodes
** DONE Consider interfaces & inheritance
*** Certain protocols will need to check if the interface is implemented first.
** TODO Add inline styles
** TODO Consider embeddable img component
** TODO Consider embedded src component
** TODO Start working on learning XPCE for a GUI
